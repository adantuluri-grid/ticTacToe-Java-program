# ticTacToe-Java-program

This is a console based Tic-Tac-Toe engine built in java.

The project follows an iterative 5 module development path, moving from basic grid rendering to a fully functional game with coordinate-based moves, input validation, and real-time win detection.

The detailed description for each of the five stages is specified in [Description for all stages](https://github.com/adantuluri-grid/ticTacToe-Java-program/tree/main/Description%20for%20all%20stages) folder.
